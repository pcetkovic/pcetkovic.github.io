    "text": "The Oesterreichische Nationalbank will present its annual report for the year 2024 at the end of March. It can be expected that the OeNB recorded a high loss again, after a loss of about 2 bn EUR in 2023. The major item impacting the loss in 2023 was net interest income, which can be expected to be strongly negative also for 2024. However, the strong increase in the value of monetary gold in EUR-terms (about 6 bn EUR in 2024) will significantly impact revaluation accounts as well as net equity, leading to a more than compensating effect for the interest-related loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain components of profit & loss account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain components of net interest income/expense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain components of net equity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Components of the annual profit/loss, net interest income/expense and and net equity in bn EUR. Source: OeNB Annual Reports.\n\n\n\nTaking a closer look on net interest income/expense shows that interest expenses on the deposit facility of banks and Target2-liabilities were the highest contributors, while interest income on the position ‘Intra-Eurosystem balances arising from the allocation of euro banknotes within the Eurosystem’ (‘Intra-EA banknote allocation’ for the remainder of the text) had a significant opposing effect. Interest income on securities held for monetary policy purposes or refinancing operations have played a lower role. For the year 2024, values for interest expenses on the deposit facility and Target2-liabilities can be expected to be in a similar range as those in 2023, while interest income on Intra-EA banknote allocation will be of a higher magnitude. Thus, the loss stemming from net interest income will probably be lower in 2024 than in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Components of net interest income/expense related to monetary policy operations and Intra-EA positions in bn EUR. Source: OeNB Annual Reports and own calculations. Notes: Values for 2024 are calculated based on the evolution of balance sheet items and the respective interest rates (MRO for Target2-liabilities and Intra-EA banknote allocation, DFR for the deposit facility).\n\n\n\nThe negative net interest income in 2023 resulted mainly from the turn in monetary policy and the respective rise in policy rates, combined with the high amount of excess liquidity in the banking system. Concerning the latter, a closer look on the main balance sheet items of the OeNB shows interesting developments. First, the stock of assets related to liquidity injecting refinancing operations has been decreasing during 2023 and 2024. However, this has not led to a decline in reserves in an equal range. A decrease in the Target2-liability would indicate that an inflow of reserves, which have been generated by other Eurosystem member countries or the ECB, would have offset for the decline in reserves stemming from decreasing refinancing operations, but this has not been the case (at least not to a relevant amount). Second, the item Intra-EA banknote allocation on asset side has increased strongly since 2023 while the item banknotes in circulation on liability side has remained nearly constant. This implies that commercial banks have returned more banknotes to the OeNB than have been issued by the latter, as a result of tourism and other cross-border effects. When banks return these banknotes to the OeNB, their reserves at the OeNB increase. In case that these additional reserves afterwards are transferred to other Euro area countries, the Target2-liability would increase (Jobst, Handig, and Schneeberger 2012). Thus, the rise in Intra-EA banknote allocation has to be absorbed by an increase either in bank reserves or the Target2-liability. Taking the whole interactions of the Austrian economy with the Euro area into account, the increase in net Intra-Eurosystem assets since 2023 is an indicator that the Austrian banking system experienced a net inflow of reserves, which have been created by the ECB or other national banks belonging to the Eurosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Balance sheet items from December 2021 to December 2024, stocks in bn EUR. Source: balance sheet data from the OeNB. Notes: Liabilities with inverted sign; Remaining balance sheet items are not shown; Net banknote-related item is calculated as the difference between Intra-EA-banknote allocation and banknotes in circulation; Net Intra-EA item is calculated as the difference between Intra-EA banknote allocation and Target2-liability.\n\n\n\nThe data show that since 2023 the increase in Intra-EA banknote allocation went along with a slight decrease in bank reserves and a volatile but on average relatively constant Target2-liability, while at the same time refinancing operations have phased out. It is thus interesting to put these items in an integrated view and see what happens to bank reserves for three different cases concerning the increase in Intra-EA banknote allocation: the increase is completely mirrored in the Target2-liability (case 1), is mirrored to 50% in Target2-liability (case 2) and does not directly affect the Target2-liability (case 3). The three examples represent the view that the additional reserves from the increase in Intra-EA banknote allocation are to a different degree used by banks for holding these reserves at their accounts at the OeNB or for external sector transactions. In all three cases the phase-out of refinancing operations leads to a strong decline in bank reserves. For the first case, this decline is partly compensated by an increasing effect due to the remaining part of the Target2-liability, which cannot be attributed to the increase in Intra-EA banknote allocation but depends on other factors connected to the external sector and the balance of payments. For the second case, the increasing effect of the residual Target2-item is lower than for the first case, while reserves also increase due to the effect related to Intra-EA banknote allocation. In the third case, the latter has a stronger impact while the former even leads to a decreasing effect on bank reserves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Contributions of various balance sheet items to cumulative changes in Reserves/Deposit facility and Target2-liability in bn EUR. Source: own calculations based on balance sheet data from the OeNB. Notes: An increasing cumulative change would increase reserves, while a decreasing cumulative change leads to a decline in reserves.\n\n\n\nWhat are the implications of these results if we allocate interest expense on the deposit facility to the accumulated stocks shown in the figure above? While for the first of the three cases Intra-EA banknote allocation would not have a direct effect on interest expenses on the deposit facility, the second and the third case would explain about 11% and 22% of interest expense on the deposit facility respectively for the year 2023. The results for 2024 show a significantly stronger impact of Intra-EA banknote allocation (24% for case 2 and 48% for case 3) resulting mainly from the increase in the magnitude of the latter although the Deposit Facility Rate (DFR) has been lowered during the year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Effects of various items on interest expense on the deposit facility. Source: own calculations based on balance sheet data and interest rates. Notes: Stocks for the various items represent cumulative changes starting at the beginning of 2022 until the end of the respective period; The item ‘Stock end-2021’ captures the total stock of reserves/deposit facility at the end of 2021.\n\n\n\nConcerning the whole Eurosystem, interest income/expenses related to Target2-claims/liabilities or claims/liabilities for Intra-EA banknote allocation do not in sum impact profits or losses, since all of these items are remunerated with the interest rate for MRO and thus only lead to a redistribution within the Eurosystem. However, the relationship between bank reserves and Intra-EA banknote allocation has important implications for country-specific profits of commercial banks. For the case of Austria, interest expenses of the OeNB related to the deposit facility explained about 25% of annual profits of the banking system in 2023 (there was an opposed effect of about 8% for interest payments by banks related to refinancing operations). The results in this blog entry show how random factors may impact profits of commercial banks, thus giving additional taxes on these profits a legitimate basis.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nJobst, Clemens, Martin Handig, and Doris Schneeberger. 2012. “The Cross-Border Movement of Euro Banknotes and Austria’s TARGET2-Liabilities.” Monetary Policy & the Economy Q4/12, 32–52."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Many central banks have turned to gold purchases during recent years, partly as a substitute for USD-denominated assets in their balance sheets (OMFIF 2024). However, the percentage share of monetary gold in total FX reserves is in general in single digit numbers for those countries which have accumulated large stocks of foreign reserves.1 In some European countries (e.g. Czechia, Hungary, Poland) central banks increased also their holdings of monetary gold in physical terms while for the case of the ECB and most of the NCBs of the Eurosystem holdings stagnated after the decrease in the early 2000s. By contrast, the value of monetary gold in EUR-terms has shown a strong increase in the Euro area in recent years, particularly in 2024. As a result, revaluation accounts more or less went in line with gold price changes and the revaluation of monetary gold holdings.\nMonthly stock of monetary gold and revaluation accounts in bn EUR (left axis) and monthly stock of Monetary gold in millions of gold fine troy ounces (right axis). Notes: 4F = ECB, U2 = Euro area. Source: ECB-RAS, ECB-ILM.\nThese large revaluations have had an opposite effect to central bank losses which have been recorded since the turn in monetary policy in the second half of 2022. Data for Internal Liquidity Management (ILM) of the Eurosystem (provided by the ECB) does not allow for a clear picture concerning those losses. The evolution of the item ‘Capital and Reserves’ mirrors the high losses recorded in the year 2023 only for some countries (e.g. Austria, France). In these cases the deduction of losses from capital and reserves is only shown in the following year, which further distorts the picture. For 2024, losses are in a similar range like in 2023, as was presented for instance by the ECB, the German Bundesbank or the Oesterreichische Nationalbank.\nAnnual changes in capital & reserves and revaluation accounts in bn EUR. Notes: 4F = ECB. Source: ECB-ILM.\nCumulative losses of 2023 and 2024 are in many cases lower than the revaluation of monetary gold in 2024, resulting in a positive effect on net equity. However, as long as monetary gold is not sold by central banks, this counteracting effect cannot be realized. Since central banks hold a high fraction of globally mined gold as reserves, a coordination mechanism would also be necessary to prevent negative price effects that would result from uncoordinated gold sales. Central Bank Gold Agreements (CBGA) were signed several times in the past in order to coordinate activities on the gold market. On the other hand, it is not really problematic for a central bank if its equity slips into the red as a result of losses. Recapitalization by the national governments, which is also being brought into play, would therefore not be a necessary step. In this respect, the movements shown in the balance sheets remain purely accounting mechanisms."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Eurosystem has completely stopped reinvestments in maturing bonds from its purchase programmes at the end of 2024, leading to an acceleration in the decline in the stock of securities which it held for monetary policy purposes. By contrast, the stock of securities, which are held for non-monetary policy purposes, shows an increasing trend since early 2023. A closer look into this item shows that among the Eurosystem member NCBs the Banque de France accounted for the major part of this increase, followed by the Bank of Greece.\nThe evolution of the balance sheet of the Banque de France shows that since the beginning of 2023 about half of the decrease in the stock of monetary policy-related securities has been compensated by an increase in the stock of other securities. The composition of securities by financial instrument shows that securities held by the BdF consisted mainly of debt securities, with equity instruments playing a negligible role.\nThe main counterpart for debt securities held by the BdF has been the French government sector, although with a declining trend in outstanding amount. If we take a look on the main EA-resident holders of debt securities issued by the French government, Eurosystem member central banks still hold the largest amount of these securities, with the BdF as the main creditor. In contrast to the Eurosystem, banks from the Euro area have increased their holdings of French government bonds with the turn in monetary policy in the second half of 2022. The residual between the market value of total outstanding debt securities of the French government sector and the amount held by EA resident holders shows that non-EA residents (e.g. US MMFs1) have also increasingly invested into French government bonds in recent years.\nThe data shows that stocks of securities in the BdF’s portfolio are trending slightly downwards for all debtor sectors. At the same time, the data for the creditor sectors of French government debt securities in combination with the evolution of debt securities held by the BdF indicate that the BdF has compensated for some of the maturing bonds in its monetary portfolio through purchases in its non-monetary portfolio. These purchases on the secondary market are likely to have a dampening effect on interest rates, which is relevant in view of the projections of high budget deficits of the French government."

    "text": "After a strong increase during the years of the financial crisis, stocks of EUR-denominated non-monetary policy related securities held by the Oesterreichische Nationalbank and issued by euro area residents show a decreasing trend since 2011 with periods of correction. The decrease set in with the start of asset purchases for the purpose of monetary policy conducted by the OeNB as part of the Eurosystem’s purchase programmes. With the declining role of monetary policy purchase programmes, non-monetary policy related securities started to play a higher role again, experiencing also a strong volatility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: EUR-denominated securities issued by EA-residents held by the Oesterreichische Nationalbank in bn EUR. S: OeNB.\n\n\n\nBalance sheet data for the four periods show that the main changes in liabilities occurred for reserves, the Target2-liability or government deposits. In April 2023 the increase in other securities was accompanied by a decrease in A020000, which indicates a switch from reserve assets to securities issued by euro area residents. The increase of securities in October 2023 was accompanied by a reduction in monetary policy securities. The latter goes along with a decline in government deposits which might have been used by the government for the redemption of debt securities. The decrease in other securities in February 2024 and the increase in February 2025 do not have any compensating movements on asset side. Thus, in these two periods the increase (decrease) of securities IS/SHOULD BE reflected by an increase (decrease) in either bank reserves or the Target2-liability. The former would be the case if the purchase was from the portfolio of domestic banks and the latter in case banks in other euro area countries were the countrepart. NON-MONETARY POLICY SECS!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges in monetary and non-monetary policy related securities (monthly).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges in all balance sheet positions for selected periods (monthly).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges in all balance sheet positions for selected periods (quarterly).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Changes in balance sheet positions of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank in bn EUR. S: OeNB.\n\n\n\nTaking a closer look on the regional composition of securities held by the OeNB shows that the developments in Q2-2023 (April 2023) were caused by an increase in equity and investment fund shares and a small increase in debt securities SECTOR along with a decrease in debt securities issued by non-residents. The fourth quarter of 2023 (October 2023) shows a decrease in debt securities issued by the domestic government and an increase in debt securities issued by non-residents. The former reflects the decline in securities held for monetary policy purposes, while the latter is probably related to the increase in non-monetary policy related securities. The first quarter of 2024 (February 2024) shows a strong decline in securities issued by non-residents, while the Q1-2025 (February 2025) shows an increase in these assets. CONNECTION TO ILM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Securities held by the Oesterreichische Nationalbank in bn EUR, S: ECB-QSA.\n\n\n\nData for Austrian portfolio investment confirms the increase in the stock of debt securities held by the OeNB for the second and fourth quarter of 2023 as well as the strong decline in the first quarter of 2024. The composition by countries shows that the developments until Q1-2024 were mainly caused by changes in debt securities issued by units located in Germany as well as International Organizations. The development of debt securities belonging to reserve assets confirms the decline in the second quarter of 2023. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality reasons it is not possible to get a closer picture which country stands behind the decline in reserve assets. TIC-data indicates that it has not been the US (TIC-LINK).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortfolio Investment by region (quertarly data).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortfolio Investment by country (bi-annual data).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebt Securities in Reserve Assets (monthly data).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Stocks of Portfolio Investment and Reserve assets of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank in bn EUR. S: ESTAT-IIP, IMF-CPIS, ECB-RAS.\n\n\n\nThe developments in non-monetary policy related securities held by the OeNB and issued by euro area residents shows that mainly foreign debtors acted as counterparts. Concerning the purchase of these assets in early 2023, data indicates that a RESTRUCTURE from foreign assets occurred. By contrast, in the other three periods there has not been any significant compensating movement on asset side but only changes in reserves of domestic banks or the Target2-balance on liability side. As reserves of domestic banks are affected mainly by monetary policy operations and inflows/outflows related to Intra-EA-transactions, it seems reasonable that the OeNB purchased these securities from banks in other euro area countries or from non-euro area countries if the settlement was conducted via correspondent banks in euro area countries.
