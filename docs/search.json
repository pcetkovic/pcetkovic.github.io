    "text": "Many central banks have turned to gold purchases during recent years, partly as a substitute for USD-denominated assets in their balance sheets. In some European countries (e.g. Czechia, Hungary, Poland) central banks increased also their holdings of monetary gold in physical terms while for the case of the ECB and the NCBs of the Eurosystem holdings stagnated after the decrease in the early 2000s. However, the value of monetary gold in EUR-terms has shown a strong increase in the Euro area in recent years, particularly in 2024. As a result, revaluation accounts more or less went hand in hand with gold price increases and the revaluation of monetary gold holdings.\n\n\n\n\n\nMonthly stock of monetary gold and revaluation accounts in bn EUR. Notes: 4F = ECB, U2 = Euro area. Source: ECB-RAS, ECB-ILM.\n\n\n\n\nThese large revaluations have had an opposite effect to losses recorded since the turn in monetary policy in the second half of 2022. Unfortunately, monthly data for Internal Liquidity Management (ILM) of the Eurosystem provided by the ECB does not allow for a clear picture concerning those losses. The evolution of the item ‘Capital and Reserves’ mirrors the high losses recorded in the year 2023 only for some countries (e.g. Austria, BELGIUM?, France). In addition, in these cases the deduction of losses from equity capital is shown in the following year. For some central banks like the German Bundesbank, which recorded a loss of XX bn EUR in 2023, the AUFLOESUNG of RUECKSTELLUNGEN led to a counteracting effect to operating losses so that capital and reserves have not been affected.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnual changes in capital & reserves and revaluation accounts in bn EUR. Notes: 4F = ECB. Source: ECB-ILM.\n\n\n\n\nTaking the evolution of policy rates into account, the losses for the year 2024 will be in a similar range as those for 2023. The results will be presented in the months to come, with the Bundesbank announced for next week. Taking the cases of Austria or France as an indicator, cumulative losses of 2023 and 2024 are expected to be lower than the revaluation of monetary gold in 2024. However, as long as monetary gold is not sold by central banks, this opposite effect cannot be realized. According to the announcements, the central banks do not intend to take this step either. On the other hand, it is not really problematic for a central bank if its equity slips into the red as a result of losses, as the case of Czechia shows. Recapitalization by the national governments or the owners, which is also being brought into play, would therefore not be a necessary step. In this respect, the movements shown in the balance sheet remain purely accounting mechanisms.\nLOCKED PROFITS. (Jr 2006)\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nJr, Nobody. 2006. “My Article.”"
